<p>I consider myself a casual NBA fan. I do not watch much of the regular season, but when the playoffs roll around, I begin to watch a lot. When I first heard about this project, I thought it would be an opportunity to watch more of the NBA, to see if my bets hit. What it turned into was me getting frustrated teams lost because I lost fake money. So thatâ€™s how that went.</p>
<p>Going in, me and my group spent a lot of time working on our algorithm. We pulled stats from basketballreference and HoopR. Stats that encapsulated the whole seasons body of work and more current stats. While we used our algorithm as a reference, we really did not rely on this as a tool to make our picks. It is difficult in the NBA to get the right statistics in there to capture a teams performance going into the playoffs. It is different than college, because of load management during the regular season and more injuries from a longer season. For the playoffs we removed any regular season stats for this very reason. We did create some rolling stats from basketballreference that we think helped us quite a bit in our accuracies. And actually, our model generally did a good job predicting games that did not have an injury. But we relied on our own intuition and judgement to make our final picks.</p>
<p>As of the time I am writing this, we have had a very up and down time betting. We have tried to mix favorites and underdogs, and it has worked in our favor sometimes and sometimes it has not. A lot of our losses come from a couple teams, as we bet on the Hawks twice, Nets twice, Grizzlies twice, and the Suns once. This accounts for a lot of our losses. What I think separates us from other groups was that we did more bets for smaller amounts, while a lot of groups would put all of their money into one game. For example, on April 20, we split our money, 50-75-50, with the 75 going to teams we had more confidence in. It worked out where the two we put 75 on won, so our profits were very good that day.We did this many different times, and it became our go to strategy. Personally, I looked for home underdogs and smart bets based on the lines we got. We have gotten bit by betting big favorites almost as much as underdogs, so we tried to avoid those alltogether. I believe betting underdogs is the way to go in a situation like this, usually in small amounts. Low risk, high reward.</p>
<p>As I am writing this we are in second place, with us down 54.67. This is actually the best positioned we have been in a while. We started off poorly, and had some bad luck early, and that put us in the hole. We are currently 12-12. We are going to start putting big money down this week with it being our last week, so this may end up really well or really poor. We have been conservative so far, and are hoping for a big payoff.</p>
